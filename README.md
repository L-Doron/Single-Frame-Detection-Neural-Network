# Single-Frame-Detection-Neural-Network
A simple test for the concept of a low SNR single frame detection algorithm using a neural network. 
In this example a number is detected in a noisy image. This is an introductory project to Tensorflow.

Only a basic understanding of neural network concepts is needed to understand this jupyter notebook. 

The project is a simple example for the following concepts:
1. Solving a single-image detection and recognition task using a neural net.
2. Using Python & Tensorflow (Keras) to define and train the network.
3. Using Keras to automatically do database augmentation while training.
4. Defining more than one cost function for the learning process.
